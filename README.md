# Teamprofilegenerator
## Description
I have created this application to allow the manager of a team to quickly generate an HTML page that displays the roster of their current team so they have quick access to basic information about their team.

## Installation
In order to install this project simply navigate to the following [link](https://github.com/Jsegel9/Teamprofilegenerator) and clone the repository down and open in VS Code. Once open run the command "NPM Install" In order to install the necessary depencies.

## Usage
Once all dependencies have been installed open the root directory in the terminal and run the command "node app.js". Follow the following promps and enter the information requested about each employee, once you have entered info for each employee on your team answer "No" to the question whether or not you would like to enter another employee and then select the option "Generate Team". This will generate an index.html file with your team roster. Open this file in your browser in order to see the application in action.
A gif detailing usage can be found below.
